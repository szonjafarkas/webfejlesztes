        <p>Zaun, also known as the City of Iron and Glass, is a large undercity district lying in the deep canyons and valleys threading Piltover. What light reaches below is filtered through fumes leaking from the tangles of corroded pipework and reflected from the stained glass of its industrial architecture. Despite the connection and proximity, Zaun and its residents are viewed by those in Piltover with contempt and prejudice.</p>
